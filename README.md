# DeepPi
End to end reconstruction of neutral pions produced in hadronic tau decays for analysis of the CP structure of the Higgs boson. 

Draft README document. 
- Production of RHTree ROOT tuples in `Production` (run with `cmsenv`)
- Tools to convert to dataframes/images in `Analysis` (run with `cmsenv` or `tau-ml`)
- NN Training and DataLoading in `Training` (run with `tau-ml`)

To install `tau-ml` conda environment run `source env.sh conda`.
